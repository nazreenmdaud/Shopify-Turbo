              <h4>They affect how much fat and calories our body will absorb.</h4>
              <p>Some types of gut bacteria can tell the body to absorb more fat from food that may cause unwanted weight gain. However certain types of bacteria can also signal the body to reduce calorie absorption.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>They affect our body metabolism</h4>
            <p>Different types of gut bacteria send signals to the body to either boost metabolism so that the body burns more calories, or to lower metabolism so it burns less energy and store the excess calories as fat.</p>

            <h4>They affect how much fat the body stores</h4>
            <p>Whenever there are excess calories in the body, they get stored in fat cells. This causes the fat cells to expand, which causes weight gain. Fat storage usually centres around the hips, thighs and belly.<br><br>

            Certain bacteria can cause increased fat storage causing the body to put on weight faster.  While other bacteria can reduce the fat cells from expanding, thus helping weight loss.</p>

         <p>Our gut contains 100 trillion bacteria.<br><br>

            They affect our body’s major functions like digestion, immune system, skin condition and inflammation.
            <br><br></p>

            <!-- <div class="img-sprite float-right css-sprite-spector-min"></div> -->

            <p>Recent research shows that the type of bacteria in the gut also affects body weight.<br><br>

            Tim Spector, a professor and expert in gut microbes said: </p><br><br>

            <blockquote>"Overweight People Have A Different Set Of Gut Bacteria Than Slim People"</blockquote><br><br>

            <p>The professor did a study at King’s College London which analyzed why some pairs of identical twins have drastic differences in body weight.<br><br>

            These identical twins had 100% of the same genes, grew up in the same environment, and ate the same food. Yet one twin was overweight while the other was slim. <br><br>

            The researchers found that the twins had different types of gut bacteria. In particular, the slimmer twins had certain types of gut bacteria which helped them to remain slim.</p><br><br>

            <br><br>

            <p>When the researchers took their gut bacteria and transplanted them into mice... Mice who received gut bacteria from overweight participants, gained weight and became obese.

                <p class="paracenter">Inflammation triggers the fat storing-hormones in the body.<br>

                As the body gains weight, the fat cells become swollen, which increases inflammation.<br>

                This cycle repeats on and on, causing continuous weight gain.

                <p>One of the reasons why Provitalize is effective at helping people to lose weight is because it contains ingredients that reduce inflammation.<br><br>

                This is also why many people who take Provitalize experience more energy, less joint pain and better digestion. <br><br>

                And that’s why, to help more people lose weight faster...<br><br>

                We’ve partnered with Chef Joel Slinger, to create an anti-inflammatory cookbook called The Slim Gut Diet. <br><br>

                <p>Chef Joel is a French-trained American Chef who’s renowned for creating extremely tasty anti-inflammatory recipes.<br><br>

                Although he has over 13 years in fine dining experience, his techniques taught in this book can be done easily.<br><br>

                This allows the anyone at home to enjoy the fullest flavor while giving you the best nutrients your body needs.<br><br>

                To ensure that they are healthy, nutritional and effective at reducing inflammation, all the recipes have been checked through and verified by two independent top nutritionists.<br><br>
                This makes it the perfect recipe guide for anyone who wants to eat delicious food and lose weight faster at the start time.<br>

                          I love the healthy Avocado & Chicken Taco. Earlier this year I was fighting a losing battle with chronic inflammation, and after getting hold of this book, I realized that substitution of foods really helped. It’s also hilarious that my husband can’t stop hanging around me in the kitchen now

I have IBS and leaky gut. One day on a whim, I decided to open this cookbook and try out one of the recipes. My god, they are so tasty! The desserts satisfy my sweet tooth. My two boys love them too. My skin has gotten better. The digestion is good. I got more energy throughout the day. I’ve since lost a few inches on my waist too.

                                diet.

                                the fat cells from getting bigger (thus preventing you from literally getting bigger as

                        <p>Unlike most other weight loss supplements and product, Provitalize was formulated based on scientific research and human studies.<br><br>

                        The main ingredient of Provitalize is called L Gasseri. Based on human clinical trials, 210 subjects who took L Gasseri lost 8.5% of body fat in just 12 weeks even without a change in diet or exercise.<br><br>

                        The other ingredients of Provitalize further enhance its weight loss effectiveness. So instead of 12 weeks, many customers start seeing results as early as 2 weeks.<br><br>

                        However, not everyone can expect to see results in 2 weeks.<br><br>

                        Everyone's body and lifestyle are different. Some might take longer to see similar results. Depending on the health of the gut, sometimes it can take up to 2 months for the bacteria to fully proliferate and self-multiply. Only then can you start seeing the benefits.<br><br>

                        Many customers have also found that they have lost a significant amount of fat even without exercising.<br><br>

                        We have tons of amazing reviews (see above), including many more video testimonials from our raving customers.<br><br> 

                        This is not to say that you can eat 4,000 calories per meal and still lose weight. That would not be possible.<br><br>

                        How Provitalize works is by allowing certain probiotic (aka bacteria) to grow in the gut. There are many research that shows that the type of bacteria in our gut has a big impact on our weight. The right kind of gut bacteria can "program" the body to lose weight automatically. (again, you can search up "Probiotic and weight loss")<br><br>

                        And for better and faster results, you can also try taking a good prebiotic, which helps the probiotic in the gut to grow even faster.<br><br>

                        And if you're not satisfied with the purchase, you're protected by our 60 days money back guarantee.<br><br>

                        Just drop us an email at contact@betterbody.co or call us at 1-702-425-4248 and we'll start processing a refund for your order immediately. No hassle. No fuss.<br><br>

                        For even greater assurance, we also include PayPal's Buyer Protection with your purchase.<br><br>

                        This means that Paypal will act as your "agent" and protect you in the event that you're not satisfied with your purchase, even to the extent of getting you your refund on your behalf.<br><br>

                        But you never need to go to that extent with Paypal, because we honor every refund request. But just knowing that Paypal is there to protect you will give you a peace of mind.

                        <p>Your results may vary depending on your lifestyle and gut health. Many customers start seeing results as early as 2 weeks. <br><br>

                        However, everyone's body and lifestyle are different. Some might take longer to see similar results. Depending on the health of the gut, sometimes it can take up to 2 months for the bacteria to fully proliferate and self-multiply. Only then can you start seeing the benefits. <br><br>

                        And for better and faster results, you can also try taking a good prebiotic, which helps the probiotic in the gut to grow even faster. <br><br>

                        For an additional boost, you can consider taking Previtalize and Postburn together as well. <br><br>

                        Previtalize is a super prebiotic blend. It works by “feeding” the probiotic strains found in Provitalize. As you may be aware, it takes 2-4 weeks for the probiotic strain to fully take root and germinate in the gut. By feeding it with prebiotic, they can proliferate faster, thus getting faster results.<br><br> 

                        In addition, ingredients in Previtalize have been found to improve sleep, reduce stress and elevate overall mood. <br><br>

                        As for Postburn, it’s for people who want to get rid of stubborn fat (or lose the last 15 pounds). <br><br>

                        The problems with stubborn fats are:<br><br> 

                        1. Stubborn fats are in the areas that are harder for the body to heat up 
                        2. Stubborn fats get less blood flow. 

                        Postburn works by boosting metabolism to the maximum, so that these stubborn fats will be burn and convert to energy. <br><br>

                        To summarise, Provitalize works well on its own. You can try it by itself to see how it goes. <br><br>

                        But if you want an additional boost, then you can try both Previtalize and Postburn as well.

                        <p>We've put hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of research into formulating Provitalize, all designed to help people to lose fat as fast as possible.<br><br>


                        However, it's impossible for every single person to see amazing transformation in just a short period of time. Everyone has a unique body with a unique lifestyle. Everyone's gut composition is different. If your gut is not in the optimal condition, then it might take much longer to see results.<br><br>


                        There are rare cases where some customers only started seeing results after 4 months.<br><br>


                        However even in those rare cases, as they continue taking 2 capsules every day, once the slim bacteria starts to fully colonize and multiply, they began to lose unwanted weight.<br><br>


                        While we do have other products like Previtalize and PostBurn which can 5-10x your weight loss results, we also want to ensure that you're fully satisfied or it's yours free.<br><br>


                        When you order Provitalize today, you're not just getting another weight loss supplement.<br><br>


                        Instead, you're getting a body that works hard to burn extra fats for you and keeps them off. This is why you're fully protected by a 60-day 100% money back guarantee.<br><br>


                        Try at least 2 months you paid.<br><br>

                        Simply drop us an email and we will process your refund. No questions asked, no troublesome phone call.</p>

                        Moringa Leaf is super high in vitamins A, E, & C while Curry Leaf contains phosphorus, iron, vitamins A, B, C, E and more.<br><br>

                        The other probiotic strains also help with immunity, blood sugar, cholesterol and more.

And a lot of our customers have reported having lower joint pain, better digestions, better immune system and more energy throughout the day.<br><br>

                        At the same time, Provitalize has been proven to help weight loss. Unlike other weight loss product that contains stimulant or caffeine, this product helps with both weight loss and general health. That's killing multiple birds with one stone. And it's only at just $1 a day.

                        <p>Provitalize works well by on its own. Many customers have found great results after taking by itself.<br><br>

                        The main ingredient of Provitalize is called L Gasseri. Based on human clinical trials, 210 subjects who took L Gasseri lost 8.5% of body fat in just 12 weeks even without a change in diet or exercise.<br><br>

                        The other ingredients of Provitalize further enhance its weight loss effectiveness.<br><br>

                        However, many customers have been asking us how they can get faster and better results.<br><br>

                        So besides Provitalize, we have created other products like Previtalize.<br><br>

                        Previtalize is a super prebiotic blend. It works by “feeding” the probiotic strains found in Provitalize. As you may be aware, it takes 2-4 weeks for the probiotic strain to fully take root and germinate in the gut. By feeding it with prebiotic, they can proliferate faster, thus getting faster results.<br><br>

                        In addition, ingredients in Previtalize have been found to improve sleep, reduce stress and elevate overall mood.

                        <p>You probably won't get the same results, because the 3 specific weight loss driven strains we've chosen are lab specific probiotics. This means you can't find them on shelves, stores or Amazon.<br><br>

                        And even if you do happen to find ID specific strains, they're going to be expensive to put together.<br><br>

                        The cost of putting Moringa Leaf, Curcumin, Curry Leaf, 3 ID specific strains, getting sunflower lecithin and DR capsules together is very expensive. They’ll probably run you $200 a month.

            <li>A study of 210 people took L Gasseri over 12 weeks found they reduce weight, abdominal visceral fat (fat
                around the organs), BMI, waist and hip circumference. Belly fat reduced by 8.5% over 12 weeks of

            <li>Obese people have different gut flora. Gut bacteria in overweight people is more efficient at extracting
                and storing energy from their diets http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16033867
